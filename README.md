# prime_curvature
We present a symbolic analysis of prime number gaps by encoding higher-order differences (G₂ and G₃) into a three-symbol alphabet (\up, \down, \flat). By treating prime gap curvature as a sequence of directional shifts, we discover recurring motifs, statistical regularities, and compressible structures that suggest an underlying symbolic grammar.
